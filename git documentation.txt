		The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this 			information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating
  5    git config --global user.name "mani"		-- EVERYTIME DEVELOPER PUSH AND PULL FOR IDENTITY 
  6    git config --global user.email "mvreddychintha@gmail.com"
